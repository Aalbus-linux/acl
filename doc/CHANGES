2.0.3 (05 March 2002)
* Clean up the --default option handling in setfacl. The old
  workarounds caused a bug for unusual input.
* Changes to the --test output format setfacl generates: ACLs that
  are not changed are now displayed as `*'.
* Fix a bug in setfacl/sequence.c:seq_delete_cmd().
* Minor changes to test scripts

2.0.2 (01 March 2002)
* Apply several patches from Andreas, namely:
* man page fixes
* libacl code reformatting
* acl_from_text errno handling

2.0.1 (27 February 2002)
* Apply Andreas Gruenbacher's diffs.
* Fix up chacl for deletion of access ACL to be in line with Andreas. 
* Incorporate the Debian packaging again.

2.0.0 (21 February 2002)
* Reworked to use the new official system call API.
* Sync up with the XFS project, the SGI folk now use this source.
* Jumped to version 2 to allow XFS users to upgrade
  (Rationale: the XFS ACL user tools were at version 1.1.X, and
  packaging tools like rpm, dpkg, etc. must be presented with a
  greater version number to allow an upgrade to proceed).
* Added the chacl command to ease migration for existing XFS users,
  and for compatibility with IRIX.
* Added a flag to allow acl_print to produce a single-line ACL, in
  addition to the multi-line format.
* Extended attribute documentation has moved into the extended
  attribute package from SGI ("attr"), this ACL package now deals
  exclusively with ACLs.
* acl_from_text sometimes did not set errno when failing.
* Moved files and simplified #includes in libacl

0.7.22
* Create a shared version of libacl, instead of linking statically.
* Added missing error reporting to getfacl do_print() function.     

0.7.16
* Minor cleanups/fixes in the make files
* The test cases in test/src have been updated to match the
  corrected ACL entry syntax (see the 0.7.15 changes).

0.7.15
* acl_from_text() now accepts mask and other entries with either two
  or three fields (`other:rwx' or `other::rwx'). Posix 1003.1e specifies
  that these entries should have three entries, while under Solaris,
  they have only two fields.
* setfacl now parses mask and other entries with two or three entries.
* getfacl now produces mask and other entries with three fields
  (`mask::rwx' instead of the previous `mask:rwx').
* acl_get_fd(), acl_get_file(), acl_set_fd(), acl_set_file() now only
  fail with errno=ENOSYS if the underlying filesystem doesn't support
  ACLs. acl_get_fd() and acl_get_file() construct ACLs from the file
  mode permission bits if the kernel supports ACLs, but no ACL extended
  attributes are defined for the file (errno=ENOATTR).
* acl_to_text() wrongly separated ACL entires with ',' instead of '\n'.
* acl_from_text() only accepted three-letter permission strings
  (rwx, ---, rw-, etc.). Now also short strings (rw, -, etc.) are
  supported.

0.7.10
* acl_get_fd(), acl_get_file() now don't return basic ACL's anymore.
* acl_set_fd(), acl_set_file() fail on filesystems that don't support
  ACLs, even if the ACL to be set is a basice ACL.
* If msgfmt is not present on a system, the message catalog(s) are
  no longer being built.

0.7.8 (19 February 2001)
* Buffer overflow bug in ACL library (acl_to_any_text).
  (Reported by Charles Bertsch <CBertsch@microtest.com>)

0.7.2 (22 November 2000)
* Replace rman with groff for building HTML versions of the
  manual pages.
* Add descriptions of the permissions required for manipulating
  ACLs to the manual pages.
* Add long options to getfacl and setfacl, update the manual pages.
* Remove some small bugs from the src/showacl Perl script.
* showacl is now integrated in getfacl.
* Bug in acl_to_any_text() for ACLs with 0 entries fixed.
* Bug in acl_to_text(): Used '\n' as the ACL entry separator.
* German messages updated.

0.7.1 (23 October 2000)
* Basic GNU gettext support and a German translation of messages
  added.

0.7.0 (22 October 2000)
* Updates to the documentation
* Now an ACL_MASK entry is cloned from the ACL_GROUP_OBJ entry
  when needed also when the ACL_MASK entry is not re-calculated
  (-n option), so setfacl doesn't complain about an invalid ACL.

0.6.8 (11 October 2000)
* src/walk_tree.c was stat()ing the targets of symbolic links in
  WALK_PHYSICAL mode.
* Removed spurious definitions from src/gettext.h that caused
  problems with several versions of GNU gettext headers
* setfacl calls acl_delete_def_file() if removing the default ACL
  of a directory that doesn't have a default ACL. i(If the user lacks
  appropriate permissions, that no-operation fails.) Fixed.
* Tiny bug in src/showacl script (mask entry not applied to owning
  group entry)

0.6.5 (10 September 2000)
* Command line options revised for POSIX compatibility (now defaults to
  -H half-logical walk, added -L logical walk, -P physical walk).
* Funny post-order option no longer documented.

0.6.0 (24 March 2000)
* Permissions were not set to the union of the ACL_GROUP_OBJ and
  ACL_MASK_OBJ entries for `setfacl -b'.
* getfacl didn't display the default ACL for links do directories.

0.5.6 (31 Jan 2000)
* Cleaned up the ACL entry ring handling in the library
* Fixed a few minor issues with setfacl
* Fixed a bug in acl_equiv_mode
* Added acl_{get,set}_{file,fd}_mode functions

0.5.5 (19 October 1999)
* Updates to the documentation
* Some other things (?)

0.5.4 (up to 14 October 1999)
* Fixed an incompatibility with more recent GNU getopt
* Fixed a problem with errno handling in lib/text.c
* Some cosmetic changes to streamline the distribution process
* setfacl now implies `user:' if neither of `user', `group:',
  `other:' and `mask:' is given. Was a major annoyance (to me).
* errno not set when acl_read was presented with an empty file.
* some missing '\n' chars in setfacl

0.5.3
* Fixed a bug in setfacl.c that caused the default mask to
  be recalculated wrong.
* Fixed a bug in acl_kernel.c:acl_check_one() that caused
  invalid ACLs to be accepted

0.5.2 (25 September 1999)
* Added doc/Implementation.txt (some internals and ideas)
* Fixed a bug in lib/manip.c that caused setfacl to reject
  some valid ACLs
* Fixed a bug that caused setfacl to produce duplicate ACL
  entries
* Fixed a bug/feature that caused `sefacl -s' to include the
  current base ACL entries in results. This is not done with
  `setfacl -bm'.
