acl-1.0.3 (24 May 2001)
	- Update libacl functions of acl_get_file, acl_get_fd,
	  so that they can do ext2 P1003.1e style semantics by default 
	  or IRIX P1003.1e semantics.
	  The change affects what is returned for a file if an
	  ACL is requested and no ACL has been explicitly set.
	  For ext2 P1003.1e style on an access ACL, 
	  a 3 entry mininum ACL based on the file's mode is returned 
	  wheras for IRIX an special empty ACL is returned.
	- Add new function, acl_set_compat, to allow IRIX compatibility 
	  if needed
