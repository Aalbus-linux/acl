Access Control List package README

Refer to the acl(5) manual page for general Access Control List
(ACL) information and references to other ACL manual pages.

The pioneering work on Linux ACLs for the ext2 filesystem was
mostly done by Andreas Gruenbacher <a.gruenbacher@computer.org>.
The getfacl and setfacl source code in this package (below the
"facl" subdirectory) was implemented by Andreas, he also wrote
the associated man pages, and his ACL website is a good source
of information on the subject:

For more information and details on how to contribute to the
XFS project see the web pages at:

Most of the initial porting work (from IRIX/XFS to Linux/XFS)
to provide ACL support and integration with Samba, was done by
developers at Connex -- the doc/CREDITS file in the xfsprogs
package has contact details for these folk.

For more information on the build process, please refer to
the doc/PORTING document.
