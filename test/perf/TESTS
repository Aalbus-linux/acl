* Overhead a default ACL causes for creating files
* Overhead ACLs cause for permission checking (deep tree)
  - User = owner
  - User != owner
* Speed of chmod (e.g., for whole tree)
* Speed of getfacl/setfacl
  - Simply get many different ACLs
  - Create new ACLs
  - Change ACLs of many files
* Speed of ls -l
