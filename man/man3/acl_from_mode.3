.TH ACL_FROM_MODE 3 "Linux ACL Library" "March 2002" "Access Control Lists"
.SH NAME
acl_from_mode \- create an ACL from file permission bits
.SH LIBRARY
Linux Access Control Lists library (libacl, \-lacl).
.SH C SYNOPSIS
.sp
.nf
.B #include <sys/types.h>
.B #include <sys/acl.h>
.sp
.B "acl_t acl_from_mode (mode_t \f2mode\f3);"
.Op
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B acl_from_mode
function creates a minimal ACL that contains the three entries with tag
types ACL_USER_OBJ, ACL_GROUP_OBJ, and ACL_OTHER, with permissions
corresponding to the owner, group, and other permission bits of its
argument
.IR mode .
.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon successful completion, this function returns a pointer to the
working storage. Otherwise, a value of (acl_t)NULL is returned, and
.B errno
is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
If any of the following conditions occur, the
.B acl_from_mode
function returns a value of (acl_t)NULL and sets
.B errno
to the corresponding value:
.TP
.SM
\%[ENOMEM]
The ACL working storage requires more memory than is allowed by the
hardware or system-imposed memory management constraints.
.SH STANDARDS
This is a non-portable, Linux specific extension to the ACL manipulation
functions defined in IEEE Std 1003.1e draft 17 (\(lqPOSIX.1e\(rq, abandoned).
