.TH ACL_FROM_TEXT 3 "Linux ACL Library" "March 2002" "Access Control Lists"
.SH NAME
acl_from_text \- create an ACL from text
.SH LIBRARY
Linux Access Control Lists library (libacl, \-lacl).
.SH C SYNOPSIS
.sp
.nf
.B #include <sys/types.h>
.B #include <sys/acl.h>
.sp
.B "acl_t acl_from_text (const char *\f2buf_p\f3);"
.Op
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B acl_from_text
function converts the text form of the ACL referred to by
.I buf_p
into the internal form of an ACL and returns a pointer to the working storage
that contains the ACL. The
.B acl_from_text
function accepts as input the long text form and short text form of an ACL as described in
.BR acl (5).
.PP
This function may cause memory to be allocated.  The caller should free any
releasable memory, when the new ACL is no longer required, by calling
.BR acl_free (3)
with the (void*)acl_t returned by
.B acl_from_text
as an argument.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon successful completion, this function returns a pointer to the
working storage.  Otherwise, a value of (acl_t)NULL is returned, and
.B errno
is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
If any of the following conditions occur, the
.B acl_from_text
function returns a value of (acl_t)NULL and sets
.B errno
to the corresponding value:
.TP
.SM
\%[EINVAL]
The argument
.I buf_p
cannot be translated into an ACL.
.TP
.SM
\%[ENOMEM]
The
.B acl_t
to be returned requires more memory than is allowed by the hardware or
system-imposed memory management constraints.
.SH STANDARDS
IEEE Std 1003.1e draft 17 (\(lqPOSIX.1e\(rq, abandoned)
