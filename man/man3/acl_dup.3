.TH ACL_DUP 3 "Linux ACL Library" "March 2002" "Access Control Lists"
.SH NAME
acl_dup \- duplicate an ACL
.SH LIBRARY
Linux Access Control Lists library (libacl, \-lacl).
.SH C SYNOPSIS
.sp
.nf
.B #include <sys/types.h>
.B #include <sys/acl.h>
.sp
.B "acl_t acl_dup (acl_t \f2acl\f3);"
.Op
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B acl_dup
function returns a pointer to a copy of the ACL pointed to by
.IR acl .
.PP
This function may cause memory to be allocated.  The caller should free any
releasable memory, when the new ACL is no longer required, by calling
.BR acl_free (3)
with the
.B (void*)acl_t
returned by
.B acl_dup
as an argument.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon successful completion, this function returns a pointer to the
working storage.  Otherwise, a value of (acl_t)NULL is returned, and
.B errno
is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
If any of the following conditions occur, the
.B acl_dup
function returns a value of (acl_t)NULL and sets
.B errno
to the corresponding value:
.TP
.SM
\%[EINVAL]
The argument
.I acl
is not a valid pointer to an ACL.
.TP
.SM
\%[ENOMEM]
The
.B acl_t
to be returned requires more memory than is allowed by the hardware or
system-imposed memory management constraints.
.SH STANDARDS
IEEE Std 1003.1e draft 17 (\(lqPOSIX.1e\(rq, abandoned)
